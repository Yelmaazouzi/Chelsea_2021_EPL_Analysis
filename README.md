# Chelsea_2021_EPL_Analysis


In the project "Analyzing Chelsea Football Club Performance in the EPL 2020-2021," I used data analysis and visualization to assess Chelsea's performance under the management of Frank Lampard and Thomas Tuchel. The analysis utilized performance metrics like Expected Goals and Non-penalty Expected Goals, revealing that Tuchel's tactical approach led to improved performance through optimal player positioning and effective response to in-game situations. The study also highlighted notable contributions from individual players, concluding that Tuchel's dynamic style resulted in better match control and quality chances, enhancing Chelsea's performance later in the season.
